# Shopify Sales & Customer Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project provides an interactive analysis of Shopify sales and customer data. It enables business stakeholders to explore key metrics, identify trends, and support data-driven decisions related to customer behavior, transaction performance, and long-term value.

## Project Overview

The main goal is to build a flexible dashboard that highlights:

- Sales performance by region, time, and product category  
- Customer segmentation (for example: repeat vs. single-order buyers)  
- Payment method usage and preferences

The dashboard was developed through clearly defined phases, including data preparation, modeling, DAX calculations, and visual design.
